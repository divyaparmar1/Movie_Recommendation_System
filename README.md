## Introduction
The Movie Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized movie suggestions to users by analyzing their historical preferences and behavior. It employs machine learning techniques to make predictions and generate recommendations. This project serves as an example of how recommendation systems can enhance user experience on platforms that provide multimedia content.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)
- You can install the required libraries using the provided requirements.txt file.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
git clone https://github.com/divyaparmar1/movie-recommendation-system.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd movie-recommendation-system

Install the required libraries.

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb to explore the implementation, step-by-step process, and code explanations.

## Data
The project uses a dataset containing movie ratings, user preferences, and other relevant information. The dataset is typically stored in a CSV file. You can either use a sample dataset provided in this repository or replace it with your own data.

## Implementation
The recommendation system is implemented using collaborative filtering techniques, specifically the user-based approach. The main steps include:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the characteristics of the data, finding patterns, and identifying user preferences.
3. User-Item Matrix: Creating a matrix where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and each cell contains the user's rating for that movie.
4. Similarity Calculation: Calculating similarity scores between users based on their preferences.
5. Prediction: Predicting ratings for movies a user hasn't watched based on their similarity to other users.
6. Top-10 Recommendations: Providing a list of top-10 recommended movies for each user.

## Evaluation
The effectiveness of the recommendation system can be evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and Mean Average Precision (MAP). Cross-validation and A/B testing can also be used to assess its performance.

## Future Enhancements
Here are a few ideas for future enhancements:
- Implement item-based collaborative filtering for more accurate recommendations.
- Incorporate deep learning techniques for better feature representation.
- Build a web interface for users to interact with the recommendation system.
- Integrate with external APIs to fetch real-time movie data and trailers.
